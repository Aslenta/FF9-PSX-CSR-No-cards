# Final Fantasy IX CSR (CutScene Remover) patches for PSX NTSC discs
Theses patches are for NTSC disc images for the intended purpose of speedrunning

Patches with "r1" after the disc number are for the Greatest Hits version

I would recommend keeping backup copies of your original disc images

1. Download and extract PPF's
2. Apply PPF's to disc images (e.g. .bin file) using PPF-O-Matic

The best place to report bugs and / or suggestions is either Github or the FF9 Speedrunning Discord server
